## 🎯 Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to create a transparent and role-based workflow for managing loan applications. Users can apply for loans, verifiers check the applications, and admins make the final approval. Once approved:

✅ **Savings amount decreases**  
✅ **Loan disbursed amount increases**  
✅ **Borrower count increases**  
✅ **Dashboards reflect real-time updates**

### 3. **Admin**
